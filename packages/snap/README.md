# Wallet Guard Snap

This Snap supports transaction simulation and automated approval revoking reminders for the user. At this time signatures are not yet supported by Snaps, so it is only transactions. Automated approval revoking is setup from `walletguard.app/onboarding` (not yet public) by connecting your wallet or inputting your wallet address, no signature necesary.
